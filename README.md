This project was built as a commentary on the Anthropocene, notably the impacts of AI focused-technological advancements and prioritization.

Built to emulate a pre-AI technological stage, this project received an `A+` in the FFAR 298 (Faculty of Fine Arts) Art in the Anthropocene course which focused on the effects of human-centric ideologies and views and the vast impacts humanity has had on the planet in the Anthropocene.
